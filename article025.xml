			<q>These taste exactly like normal brownies, I don't

		<p>
			While healthy brownies might seem an oxymoron, I can
			assure you these are just about the most clandestinely
			healthy thing I've ever made.
			The secret ingredient is beans (say whaaat?!) &#8211;
			chickpeas in fact, also known as garbanzo beans in the
			US. 
			I know, I know, beans in brownies does sound a little
			funny. I thought so too when I first heard of it, and
			avoided all bean-containing recipes until I discovered
			this delicious-looking recipe for 
			<a
				href="http://proteinpow.com/2015/01/melting-heart-protein-brownies.html">Melting
				Heart Protein Brownies</a>. 
			Gosh, am I glad I decided to give baking with beans a try! 
			These turned out so fabulously moist and chewy from the
			chickpeas, fudgey from the peanut butter, and
			chocolate-rich from the cacao and protein powder.
			The best part was sticking little squares of sugar-free
			chocolate into each brownie when it was still hot from
			the oven, making the chocolate melt into the centre and
			giving it an fondant-like effect.

			<q>I would never have been able to tell the difference,</q> said K after I revealed secret ingredient to him.
			In my chocolate-connoisseur's opinion, they were so delicious it was almost indecent.
			Yup, these vegan protein treats taste better than the
			real thing and might just be the best <span
				class="nm">Lila, Chop!</span> recipe I've ever
			made.

		<h3> 
			 I heart Peanut butter (Peanut Butter &amp; Co. product review) 
		</h3>
		<p>
			There are so many different peanut butters available on
			the market these days, ranging from the original 
			Skippy to organic peanuts-only spread that you grind
			yourself in Whole Foods, to to decadent protein- and vitamin-fortified
			peanut butters.
			The flavour combination seems limitless &#8211;
			gone are my childhood days when it was just the ol' PB&amp;J combo on whole-wheat toast (minus the crusts, of
			course), that I would eat every day after coming home from school.
		       	I recently received free samples of three different flavours from	
			<a href="http://ilovepeanutbutter.com/">Peanut Butter &amp; Co.</a> (thank you!)
			, and immediately fell in love with their
			<a href="http://ilovepeanutbutter.com/whitechocolatewonderful.html/">
				White Chocolate Wonderful</a> flavour &#8211; a creamy
			and delicious blend of peanuts and white chocolate.
		</p>
		<p>
			Made with entirely natural ingredients and containing
			no cholesterol, trans fats, hydrogenated oils,
			or high-fructose corn syrup, these peanut butters
			are gluten-free, vegan, kosher, and truly delicious. 
			Eat it on toast, crackers, together with fruit, or with
			a spoon straight out of the jar. 
			The best part: it works fabulously in this
			<span class="nm">Lila, Chop!</span> protein fudge
			brownie recipe!  
			With a whole range of flavours, I can't wait to try
			their cinnamon raisin swirl or dark chocolate dreams
			(can you tell I love chocolate?).

		<h3>Pimp my Brownie Recipe Tip</h3>
		<p>
			Why not try pairing this Protein Fudge Brownie with a <a href="http://www.lilachop.com/article020.html">PB Fudge Protein Cookie</a>?
			Because cookies + brownies = crownies, and no one ever
			said you can't have both (especially when they're both
			clean and healthy <span class="nm">Lila, Chop!</span>
			protein recipes).

			I discovered Questnutrition's protein bars a couple of years ago when I
			was looking for gluten- and soy-free protein bars on amazon. (I
			had recently been diagnosed with a host of food
			intolerances and was in a panic to find something I
			could still eat.) Unfortunately, the first generation
			of quest bars tasted like cardboard, and were so
			difficult to chew that they would give me a jaw-ache.
			Frustrated, I decided they had been a waste of money. A
			few years later however, pictures of quest bars kept
			popping up on my Instagram feed on Instagram, and I
			wondered why they were so trendy all
			of a sudden. I decided to try out their new flavours,
			and oh Lila, am I glad I did!

			I discovered through Instagram that the trick with
			questbars is to microwave them first.  (Whoever first
			thought of this must be both some bizarre genius.)
			Just 10 seconds in the microwave makes a tremendous
			difference, both in taste and chewability, thereby
			significantly increasing their edibility. 
			It also makes the bar easier to mould into shapes for
			baking - but be warned! They settle and harden very
			quickly.

			As you can see, this is a very nutrient- and protein-
			dense treat. 
			To make it lighter, simply halve the recipe, or skip
			the protein powder altogether. 

		</p>

		<p>	
			<b>A little note on the macro nutrients:</b> 
			although the macros for the total amount of
			carbohydrates looks high, questbars are made up of
			insoluble prebiotic plant fibres called
			<i>Isomalto-Oligosaccharides,</i> therefore the amount
			of net carbohydrates is significantly lower. 
			That's why I can safely call this recipe low-carb and high-protein.

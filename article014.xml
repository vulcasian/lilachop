			Oh how I love cheesecake! It seems everyone, in fact,
			loves cheesecake.  
			And birthday cake, and chocolate, and dark cherries.  
			So I decided to combine all these, into one: birthday
			cake confetti cheesecake with dark chocolate and cherry
			topping.  
			(Believe it or not, there is such thing as
			confetti-flavoured "Corfetti" protein powder.)

			I made this cheesecake during my last week in Switzerland,
			whilst I was rummaging through my kitchen deciding
			which protein powders to pack and bring with me to France, 
			and which to discard. 
			With just a couple of scoops of my beloved Cellucor
			COR-fetti protein powder left, I decided to finish it
			by using it to flavour my protein cheesecake. 
			I love the look of it, since the colourful particles
			show up even after baking and just adds a cool, eye-candy
			effect along with a delicious birthday cake flavour.

			This cake turned out absolutely beautiful, and I can't
			even begin to describe how heavenly my entire apartment smelled
			by the time 20 minutes had passed with the cake in the
			oven. 
			I spiffed it up with cake decoration and decided to serve it the
			next day during my farewell party.  
			Unfortunately, having decided to announce my leaving
			party on an all too short-notice, I ended up cancelling
			it and simply attending my best friend, Anna's, dinner
			party instead in Geneva. 
			So the guests at that dinner party got to savour it over
			explanations of the benefits of baking with protein
			powder.	</p>

		<p>
			This recipe is an upgrade from my 
			<a
				href="http://www.lilachop.com/article002.html">Tahini
				Cheesecakeini</a>, one of my first <span
				class="nm">Lila, Chop!</span> recipes. 
			After getting so much positive feedback 
			I decided to try it again with a
			different, birthday-cake flavour, a sweeter, base and a
			richer, more chocolatey-topping. 
			Thus I replaced the tahini base ingredient with
			chocolate chip cookie dough flavoured almond butter,
			the vanilla protein powder with confetti-flavour, and
			added cake decoration sprinkles, cherries and more dark
			chocolate on top... 
			Mmmm, pure decadence!  
			It also upped the eye-candy and drool effect. 
			The original recipe was adapted from <a
				href="http://proteinpow.com/">Proteinpow</a>'s
			recipe <a
				href="http://proteinpow.com/2013/08/dark-chocolate-almond-whey-protein.html">Dark
				Chocolate Almond Cheesecake</a> by Anna Sward,
			who said <q>It's as close to protein magic as one can
				get.</q> 
			Let's see if you think this one is even better!

		<h3>
			Recipe tip
			</h3>
		<p> 
			This recipe makes eight slices (perfect for a dinner
			party dessert), and macro-nutrient information is per
			slice.  
			To make the recipe leaner, simply use 0% Greek
			yoghurt, less chocolate and sugar-free syrup instead of
			honey or agave. 
			To make the recipe richer or sweeter, add more syrup to
			the base and sugar or stevia drops in the mixture.

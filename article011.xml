		<p>
			One of my first requests for <span class="nm">Lila,
				Chop!</span> came from Anna, my best friend
			from college. 
			She asked me to post a smoothie recipe for beginners,
			and I was more than happy to oblige.
			I owe a lot to Anna (<q>Mumsi Hallaulu</q>),
			whose support, humour, and presence have enriched my life in
			Switzerland more than I could ever quantify.
		       (<q>Mums</q> is the Swedish equivalent for <q>yummy</q>,
		       and times spent together are mums indeed!) That's why
		       this recipe is dedicated to her, the <b>Ananabanana
			       Chocolate Smoothie for Beginners</b>.

		<p> 
			Whilst staying at Anna's, I had the bizarre experience
			of witnessing the results of her grocery shopping when
			she came home carrying two bags full-to-bursting, with
			nothing but plain yoghurt, milk chocolate
			and several kilos worth of fresh bananas. <q>I just
				really felt like having bananas</q>, she said.
		</p>
		<p>	
			Having spent most of my life detesting the taste, smell
			and sight of them (thanks to being overfed
			bananas as a child), I found this a little
			incredulous. 
			But as her best friend, it was my duty to honour her
			tastes and to create a banana experience that
			both of us would find delicious enough to share&#8212;thus
			this recipe serves two.
			That's why when I decided to post my first recipe
			dedication to her, it had to consist of the three 
			ingredients of her weekly grocery shopping, and be
			simple enough for smoothie-making-beginners.

		<h3>
			Banana &amp; Recipe Tips
		</h3> 
		<p>
			I've found that using frozen fruit is so much better
			than fresh fruit in smoothies as it gives it a more
			ice-cream like consistency and experience. 
			That's why I always make sure to chop up
			bananas (or any other fruit) the night before and
			freeze them in zip-lock bags. 
			Note that if you don't chop them up <i>before</i>
			freezing them, they will become impossible to blend,
			and might break your blender altogether!
		</p>	
		<p>
			For an even richer banana taste, try using a
			banana-flavoured protein powder. I have yet to try one,
			but I have heard there is a delicious one out
			there from <a
				href="http://www.myprotein.com/sports-nutrition/impact-whey-protein/10530943.html">Myprotein</a>.	
		</p>
		<p>
			Finally, for a leaner recipe, use low-fat plain
			yoghurt.  I normally use 0% Greek yoghurt, but as this
			recipe is dedicated to Anna (<q>Low fat? Yeah
				right</q>), I used the normal, full-fat
			version.  </p>

		<h3> 
			Pimp My Smoothie Tip
		</h3>
		<p>
			People often ask me how I manage to decorate my
			smoothies, and if I was taught this at hotel school
			during some <q>art de la table</q> course. 
			It's far simpler than you think, so I'm going to
			give you a tip on how to pimp up your
			smoothie decorations: Simply dip the
			smoothie glasses in shredded coconut. 
			The trick to get the coconut to stick to the rims of
			the glasses is to dip the part you want the coconut to
			stick to in a sticky substance, such as honey. 
			Pour honey, agave, pancake syrup or any sugar-free
			syrup onto a paper towel. Pour the coconut onto a
			separate towel. Dip the rims of the glass in honey, then
			dip them in coconut. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Voila! Decorated glasses.

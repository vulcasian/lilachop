			Imagine oatmeal, but fluffier, yummier, easier to make,
			and one you don't even have to cook. 
			That's Overnight Oats. 
			For those of you who believe breakfast is the best meal
			of the day but don't have time to cook in the mornings,
			this is the perfect recipe for you. 
			All it takes is a 2-minute prep the night before,
			letting the oats soak up the liquid overnight in the
			fridge, and voila! Ready to eat the following morning with all your
			favourite, flavourful toppings. Mmmm.

			Although not entirely Paleo (depending on how you see
			oats), this recipe is a morning nutrition bomb: 
			packed with fibre, vitamins, healthy fats
			and natural proteins.  
			Ever heard of the <a

				Diet</a>? A Nordic version of paleo, which

		The secret to no-cook oatmeal is the magic that happens
		in the fridge overnight. Oats soaked in milk swell and
		soften into no-cook oatmeal known as as bircher (Swiss) muesli. 
		The best way to store overnight oats in the fridge is
		actually in an air-tight container, such as a glass jar. 
		So if you have one of these, simply add the base ingredients
		into the jar, seal the lid and gently shake the ingredients
		together.
		Because overnight oats are best prepared

       		And what better way to serve them the next morning than in a martini glass?

			If you are allergic to raw nuts, simply omit the nut-butter ingredient.
			Otherwise, I cannot recommend you to try it enough.
			In my opinion, almond butter is God's gift to health
			foodies, and can be eaten with almost anything at
			any time of day. 
			For this recipe, I used <a

				coconut cardamom almond butter</a>, the most
			delicious nut butter for someone who adores cardamom
			(like all Swedes).

			Finding fresh berries difficult to get a hold of at
			this time of year? 
			No problem! 
			Although this recipe is served cold, overnight oats can
			just as easily be turned into hot oatmeal. 
			Perfect for frosty winter mornings, and the perfect
			solution if you only have frozen berries instead of
			fresh ones &#8211;
			simply stir in the frozen berries to pre-refrigerated
			overnight oats, and microwave for approximately 1-2
			minutes. 
			Add the rest of the toppings last.

		<h3>
			Protein Overnight Oats
		</h3>
		<p>
			To increase the protein content of your recipe, try a protein-fortified 
					<a
						href="http://feelalive.nu/buff-bake/">almond
						or peanut butter</a> that come in many delicious and surprising different flavours. 
					You could also mix half a scoop of
					<a
						href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005CNFHQ2/?tag=lich048-20">Paleo protein powder</a>
					or any <a href=
						"http://www.mathem.se/varor/protein-o-aminosyror">vegan
						or whey</a> protein powder with
					the milk, and let the oats soak up the
					protein overnight.  
		</p>

			The basic Overnight Oats recipe calls for 1 part oats to
			1 - 1.5 parts liquid, depending on the desired
			consistency.
			(The liquid can be any vegan or dairy milk to a mix of milk and
			yoghurt, milk and apple sauce or mashed banana, and even
			coconut milk.)
			From thereon, there are endless numbers of topping and
			flavour combinations you can try!

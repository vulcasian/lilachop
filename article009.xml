			My name is Christina, and Delila-sky (or Lila) is my
			Siberian Husky&#8211;the muse behind the name, Lila,Chop!  
			I come from Thailand and Sweden, and I am passionate
			about everything related to fitness, health food,
			gourmet food, travel and Siberian huskies.
			I am also a pilot, and I love to fly.

			But let's talk abut healthy gourmet food, a supposed
			oxymoron.

			Having graduated from the world's top hotel school, Ecole
			hôteliere de Lausanne in Switzerland, I suddenly had
			a lot of time on my hands and the usual choices to make
			about what to do with my life and who I want to be,
			et cetera.

			Raised as a pesce-vegetarian, and having spent the
			better part of my teens and early twenties
			yo-yo-dieting and obsessively experimenting different food regimens
			(vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free, raw food,
			macrobiotic and detox fasts) I was fundamentally fed up
			of dieting and restricting myself.

			I have always been a real foodie and known for my sweet
			tooth &#8211;some of my favourite childhood memories
			include trying out Argentinean snow fish at one of
			Bangkok's top Italian restaurants and baking Swedish
			cinnamon buns (<q>kanelbullar</q>) with my grandmother in
			Gothenburg.

			I love gastronomy, fine-dining, luxury ingredients such
			as white truffle and lobster, and gourmet-cooking at
			home. 

			I will admit a secret here: I have a terrible
			sweet tooth. 

			My favourite desserts in the world include
			molten chocolate (<q>molleaux au chocolat</q>) and sticky
			toffee pudding (how much unhealthier can one's tastes
			get?). 

			I love visiting chocolate atelieres and sampling
			the richest hand-made truffles creations of the day,
			and buying the finest ingredients to bring back home to
			use in my baking.

			Spending four-years at the most renown hotel
			school in the world did nothing but cultivate and
			refine my taste and interest in this. 

			Furthermore, kitchen practicals gave me ample
			opportunity to refine my baking skills, such as making
			Swedish sticky chocolate cake (<q>kladdkaka</q>) one of the
			most notoriously sinfully delicious and unhealthy
			desserts out there, in large quantities.

			But I had a problem&#8211;I could not coincide this
			with my passion for health and fitness, with my female
			pride of wanting to look good in a bikini, and my sound
			belief in taking care of one's body by nourishing it
			with wholesome, lean and natural foods.

			That was the perpetual conflict: being a real foodie,
			but also a real health junkie. 

			Above all, after years of illness and general
			ill-treatment of my own body, I was just starting to
			heal physically. 

			For the first time in my life, I was hitting the gym
			regularly, and hard. 

			Six days a week, two hours a day&#8211;weights, and
			adding more strength-training to my previously
			card-dominant workouts along with high intensity
			interval training.  

			I began to find myself in the best shape of my life, and
			getting continually stronger, fitter, and leaner every
			month.

			This could only have been possible with the
			right approach to food and nutrition, however. 

			Without wanting to restrict myself and stubbornly
			refusing to get sucked back into any diet mentality, I
			had to learn how to eat properly for this intensity of
			workouts, lifestyle and fitness goals. 

			Sadly, there seemed to be no room for a gourmet foodie
			in this picture&#8211;boring cottage-cheese salads,
			egg-white omelettes, cardboard-tasting protein bars and
			grainy, protein shakes! 

			(And every time such dire thoughts crossed my mind, I
			would find myself inexplicably fantasising about ice
			cream.)

		<p>
			Fortunately, I found a way around that &#8211;the perfect
			compromise between fine food and fine health:
			clean cooking and baking. 

			By clean, I mean using natural, whole, organic,
			predominantly-unprocessed  ingredients. Ingredients low
			in sugar, fat, gluten and lactose. 
			
			Thanks to Instagram, I found hundreds of recipe ideas
			from fellow health-foodies, and tips from
			fitness models on how to make decadent, protein-rich
			desserts worthy of the names <i>pre- or post-workout meal</i>. 

			By protein-rich, I mean incorporating protein
			powder into the actual recipes themselves. 
			In fact, I learned that the one major secret ingredient
			was baking with <b>protein powder</b>.  
			I call this the sex appeal behind my healthy creations,
			because it's the one ingredient that spiffies up my
			creations in terms of consistency, flavour, sweetness
			and nutritional value.

			I began experimenting, and inviting my girlfriends
			over for Sunday brunch to taste out my clean, healthy
			and protein-filled creations. 

			Everything from two-layered frozen smoothies to protein
			pancakes to home-made protein bars and cheesecake... it
			was incredible. 
			I realised I was <i>good</i> at it.
			I loved making it, and they loved trying it.
			Pretty soon all my friends were asking me for my
			recipes, and I could not keep up with scribbling them
			down on post-its or writing them in the Instagram
			comments of my photos.

			One day, someone very special to me called K, decided
			to help me finally start my own blog. 

			Being the most regular sampler of all my recipes, he
			knew more about my protein creations and the process
			behind them than anyone else. 

			Wracking our minds for a suitable name (<q>the protein
				bakery</q> seemed too generic) he was inspired by my
			beloved Lila, the travelling husky and cat-connoisseur.
			The dog who is known for her refined tastes and
			response to the <q><b>Chop!</b></q> command, and who can be
			expected to make a sudden appearance in the kitchen
			when I'm baking, deserves to name my online cafe and
			recipe collection.

			Thus, <b>Lila, Chop!</b> was born.  
			The online cafe and recipe blog that promises 
			<i><b>Clandestine Health food and Living.</b></i>
				<q>Fatally delicious, baking clean with protein
					powder.</q>

			<b>Lila, Chop! 's promise to you:</b>
		</p>	
		<p> 
			Dear fellow Chopper,

		</p>
		<p>
			As you are reading this site, you are obviously
			interested in healthy food and delicious recipes. 
			You may be a gourmet-foodie, a health-food junkie, or a
			fitness-addict.  You may be on a restrictive diet due
			to food intolerances and struggling to find ways to
			make bread and desserts that don't taste like
			sandpaper, or your average, health-conscious person
			interested in ways to increase your protein-intake in a
			delicious way. 

		</p>
		<p>	
			My promise to you with Lila, Chop! is that ALL the
			ingredients I use are healthy, clean and wholesome. I
			link the products I use to the websites I bought them
			from, so you can buy them online yourselves. (<b>all</b> the
			products I mention are ones I choose to use because I
			personally find them of high-quality, suitable for my
			recipes and generally yummy.) 
			Most of the recipes I make are gluten- and
			lactose-free, and almost all of them are high in
			protein. 
			Check out the nutritional information and the
			food-icons to see exactly what kind of nutritional
			profile each recipe has! And remember, you can always
			adapt them to your liking.
			If you choose to post photos of your creations from my
			recipes or to repost the recipes themselves, be sure to
			cite me! 
			Likewise, I make sure to cite all the recipes
			I adapt and find inspiration from.  
			Happy baking, and namnam.

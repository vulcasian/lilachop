			My name is Christina. I am the owner of <span
				class="nm">Lila, Chop!</span> and the Instagram
			account <a
				href="http://instagram.com/christinahallalulu">christinahallalulu</a>.
			Delila-Sky (a.k.a "Lila") is my Siberian Husky and muse
			behind the name of this recipe blog.   
			I'm half-Thai, half-Swedish, and currently live in
			Toulouse, France where I'm studying nutrition alongside a Masters degree in
			Air Transport Management (an odd combination, huh?). 
			I'm passionate about everything related to health,
			fitness, coffee, travel, scuba-diving, and of course,
			food. Gourmet, fine-dining, gastronomy food, in fact. 
			I am also a pilot, and I love to fly.

		<p> 
			But let's talk about my love of healthy gourmet food&#8212;a supposed
			oxymoron.
		</p>

		<p> 
			Having graduated from Ecole hôteliere de
			Lausanne in Switzerland, I suddenly found myself with a
			some time on my hands and the usual pressing
			decisions to make about what to do with one's life.
			Being the food-lover and health-nut that I am, there
			had to be something I could do with this!
			Something non-traditional, something that would reflect
			my personal journey, creativity, and beliefs.  
		</p> 
		<figure>

			<figcaption>Vegetarians...</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p>	
			Raised as a pesce-vegetarian and having spent the
			better part of my teens and early twenties
			yo-yo-dieting and obsessively experimenting with
			different food regimes, (vegan, vegetarian,
			gluten-free, raw food, paleo, macrobiotic, and detox fasts), I
			was fundamentally fed up of dieting and restricting
			myself. 
			I joined the "anti-diet" health movement, without even
			realising there was such a thing. 
			I started eating chicken, and for the first
			time in my life, tried beef.  
			<i>I actually really liked it!</i> 
		</p>
		<p>
			I have always been a foodie; some of my
			favourite childhood memories include digging into snow
			fish at one of Bangkok's top Italian restaurants,
			eating pasta with fresh truffles in a Swiss alpine
			restaurant, and baking Swedish cinnamon buns
			(<q>kanelbullar</q>) with
			my grandmother.
		</p>

			<figcaption>Letting K have the first kanelbulle bite,
				for he would later help me build this site.</figcaption> </figure>
		<p>
			I love fine-dining and the culinary arts. 	
			One of my favourite classes in college was molecular gastronomy.
			I love beautifully-presented dishes and that
			moment when the cheese or dessert trolley comes out at
			the end of a meal, right after the bread-crumbing. 
			<b>In fact, I'm a real food snob</b>.
			But what I can be most accused of, is that I
			possess a <i>terrible</i> sweet tooth. 

			My favourite desserts in the world include
			molten chocolate cake (<q>molleaux au chocolat</q>) and sticky
			toffee pudding. 
			Now imagine what you would get if these
			two sinfully rich and sugary desserts had a love-child:
			Swedish sticky chocolate cake, <q>kladdkaka</q>. 
			Yup, that's the best one of all, and what I lived off
			of during my boarding-school days. 

		</p>
		<p>
			Spending four-years at the world's most renown hotel
			school did nothing but cultivate and
			refine my taste and interest in food.  
			Day trip to a chocolate factory for a history of
			chocolate followed by coffee and truffle-pairing?  
			Hell, yes.
			Internship at Nestlé Nespresso for dark
			chocolate and Grand Cru espresso-tasting? Yes, yes! 
			An expanding waistline as a consequence of all this?
			Unfortunately, yes as well.	

		</p>

		<p> 
			So I had a problem: I could not coincide this love of food
			with my passion for health and fitness, with my 
			pride in wanting visible abs, and my sound
			belief in taking care of one's body by nourishing it
			with wholesome, lean and natural foods.
		</p>

		<p>
			That was the perpetual conflict: my taste buds wanted one
			thing, my body said another. 

			Above all, after years of illness and general
			ill-treatment of my own body, I was just starting to
			heal physically. 

			For the first time in my life, I was hitting the gym
			regularly, and hard. 

			Six days a week, two hours a day: lifting, cardio, and
			high intensity interval training (HIIT) from <a href=
				"http://www.bodyrock.tv/">bodyrocktv</a>. I
			switched the focus of my workouts from cardio to
			strength-training and weight-lifting, and only then did
			the results start to show.  

			I began to find myself in the best shape of my life, and
			getting continually stronger, fitter, and leaner every
			month. 
		</p>

		<p>
			This could only have been possible with the
			right approach to food and nutrition, however.
			You know that saying, <q>you can't out-exercise a bad diet?</q> 
			Well, it's true; I had to make sure that what I
			was putting into my body would give me sustained energy
			to last throughout my workouts, and enough protein to
			repair my muscle tissue after.	

			Without wanting to restrict myself, and stubbornly
			refusing to get sucked back into any diet mentality, I
			had to learn how to eat properly for this intensity of
			exercise and for my fitness goals. 

		</p>
		<p>
			Sadly, there seemed to be no room for a gourmet-foodie
			in this lifestyle. Only boring cottage-cheese salads,
			egg-white omelettes, cardboard-tasting protein bars and
			weird-smelling protein shakes! 

			(Every time such dire thoughts crossed my mind, I
			would find myself inexplicably fantasising about ice
			cream.)
		</p>

		<p>
			Fortunately, I found a way around that; the perfect
			compromise between food, fitness and figure (the 3
			F's). It was clean cooking and baking. 

			By clean, I mean using whole, organic,
			unprocessed  nutrient-dense ingredients. 
			Foods low in sugar and saturated/trans fat, that are as
			close to their natural state as possible. 
			And then protein powder, of course. 
			
		</p>
		<p>
			Thanks to Instagram, I found hundreds of recipe ideas
			from fellow health-foodies, and tips from
			fitness models on how to make decadent, protein-rich
			desserts compatible with almost any meal plan. 

			By protein-rich, I mean incorporating protein
			powder into the actual recipes themselves. 
			In fact, I learned that the one major secret ingredient
			was baking with <b>protein powder</b>.  
			I call this the sex appeal behind my healthy recipes,
			because it's the one ingredient that spiffs up my
			creations in terms of consistency, flavour, sweetness
			and nutritional value <i>without</i> the empty calories
			of traditional desserts.

		<p>
			I began experimenting in the kitchen and inviting my girlfriends
			over for Sunday brunch to taste my clean, healthy
			and protein-filled creations. 

			Everything from two-layered frozen smoothies to protein
			pancakes to home-made protein bars and cheesecake... it
			was decadent. It was incredible. It was a foodie's heaven. 
			And I realised I was <i>good</i> at it.
			Pretty soon all my friends were asking me for my
			recipes, and I could not keep up with scribbling them
			down on post-its or writing them in the comments of my
			<a
				href="http://instagram.com/christinahallalulu">Instagram
			</a> photos.

			One day, someone very special to me called K, decided
			to help me finally start my own blog. 

			Being the most regular sampler of all my recipes, he
			knew more about my protein creations and the process
			behind them than anyone else. 

			Wracking our minds for a suitable name (<q>the protein
				bakery</q> seemed too generic) he was inspired by my
			beloved Lila, the travelling husky and cat-connoisseur.
			The dog who is known for her refined tastes and
			response to the <q><b>Chop!</b></q> command, and who can be
			expected to make a sudden appearance in the kitchen
			when I'm baking, deserves to name my online cafe and
			recipe collection. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Thus, <span class="nm">Lila, Chop!</span> was born.  
			The online cafe and recipe blog that promises 
			<i><b>Clandestine Health food and Living.</b></i>
				<q>Fatally delicious, baking clean with protein
					powder.</q>

			They say the most common time of year to gain weight 
			is between Christmas and New Year, where the festive
			season seems to encourage us to abandon of our
			health and fitness goals.
			We've all been there &#8211; we've all experienced the
			post-Christmas dinner food coma that somehow lasts for
			days and the champagne-hangover that causes us to wake
			up with a cringe.  
			We've felt how easy it is to fall out of our exercise
			routines whilst on holiday, and we've all made
			those resolutions to get fitter, healthier, and leaner
			for the coming year.
			Thus I present Winter Detox Smoothie, the perfect
			recipe to detox your bad habits and to help kick-start
			your healthier lifestyle.

		<h3>
			Smoothie Recipe Tips
		</h3> 
		<p>
			Once again, using frozen fruit is so much better than
			fresh fruit in smoothies as it gives it a thicker,
			creamier consistency.
			However, if you prefer using fresh berries, add a
			couple of ice cubes to your blender to make it more ice
			cream-like.	
		</p>	
		<p>
			To up the nutritional content of your smoothie, add
			Greek yoghurt, flax seeds, and/or banana.
			Use vegan protein powder instead of whey if you're into
			that.
			(I'll often mix whey and vegan protein
			powders together, making my smoothie less sweet and 
			diversifying my sources of protein.)
			This makes a fantastic breakfast smoothie, and will
			keep you comfortably full and going all morning! 
		</p>
		<p>
			To decorate your glass like I have, simply cover the
			rim of your glass with a sticky substance like honey,
			then dip the glass in cake sprinkles. 
			Check out the <q>Pimp My Smoothie Tip</q> section of my
			<a href="article011.html">Ananabanana Choco smoothie</a>
			for more detailed instructions!

		<h3> 
			Only Protein (paleo product review) 
		</h3>
		<p>
			Since hearing about the paleolithic diet, I've been
			experimenting with various paleo products and recipes.
			Albeit a bit extreme, overall I think it's a sound
			approach to nutrition, emphasising lean meats, healthy
			fats, and vegetables whilst limiting starches and all
			processed-foods. 
			However, I was concerned to hear protein powder did not
			count as paleo, until I found
			<a href="https://www.onlyprotein.com/">
				Only Protein</a>
		       &#8211; the only paleo whey protein powder. 
			I was lucky to receive free samples from this New
			Zealand company, and used their vanilla protein powder
			in this recipe. (Which turned out fabulously, I may add.)
		</p>
		<p>
			What can I say about this product? 
			Aside from being slightly too sweet and rather
			difficult to get a hold of, it's hands-down one of the
			best and purest whey protein powders on the market.
			Their above-average prices are justified by the
			quality of their ingredients, and I would highly
			recommend this to anyone looking for a clean whey
			protein powder!

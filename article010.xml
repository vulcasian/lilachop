			Dear fellow Chopper,
		</p>
		<p>
			As you are reading this site, you are obviously
			interested in healthy food and delicious recipes. 
			You may be a gourmet-foodie, a health-junkie, or a
			fitness-addict.  
			You may be on a restrictive diet due to health reasons, 
			have special dietary requirements due to competitive
			sports, or on an elimination diet due to food
			intolerances and struggling to find recipes that don't
			taste like sandpaper. 
			Or you might simply be a health-conscious
			person interested in ways to increase your
			protein-intake in an easily creative and delicious way. 
		</p>
		<p>	
			Whatever the reason, welcome to <span class="nm">Lila, Chop!</span> 
			My primary goal with this recipe blog is to provide you with
			simple recipes that look sinfully delicious yet are nutritiously healthy. 
		</p>
		<p>
			My secondary goal was to create a recipe website myself. 
			There are a lot of blogging tools out there, ones that
			I have used before and found easy but limiting. I did
			not want to find myself stuck with someone else's
			template, or unable to add cool features (such as the
			change servings tool!) as I wish. 
			So with the help, and support of K, I decided to
			take the time to learn HTML, CVS, CSS, Vim and Unix, in order to
			build this website and create all the recipes myself in
			terminal. The site is powered by 
			<a href="http://kristaps.bsd.lv/sblg/">sblg</a>, K's offline blog utility for UNIX on 
			<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a>.
			I must say, it's far more awesome to do it
			this way. Who says chicks can't learn to
			program?
		</p>
		<p>
			If you choose to post photos of your creations from my
			recipes or to re-post the recipes themselves, be sure to
			cite me!  Likewise, I make sure to cite all the recipes
			I adapt and find inspiration from.  
		</p>
		<p>
			Happy baking, and namnam.
		</p>

			<b>Home page</b>
		</p>
		<p> 
			This is the Home page, where you can see a blog-roll of
			the latest articles and recipes.  
			The left-hand navigation pane, you will see a list
			of articles by tags, such as Recipes by
			Nutritional Profile: Gluten-fee, Low-Carb, Vegan,  et
			cetera, or Recipes by Type: Smoothie, Cake, Savoury
			dishes, et cetera. (On a smart phone, you will not see
			the navigation pan. Use the Home and Archive button to
			navigate instead.) 
			At the bottom of the page you will see a link to the
			 <img class="hicon" src="files.png" alt="Archive"/> 
			Archives, where you will find a list of all my recipes.
			You can always navigate back home by clicking on the
			<img class="hicon" src="home.png" alt="Home"/> Home icon, or the blog title.
			Want to follow my on Instagram, get recipe updates with
			RSS feed, or email me? Click on the icons at the top of
			the page. 
			I will always appreciate personal feedback and
			comments about my site, and try to answer questions as
			promptly as I can.

			<b>Recipe page</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			Check out the nutritional information and the
			food-icons to see exactly what kind of nutritional
			profile each recipe has! 
			By hovering your mouse over each icon, you can see what
			the icon indicates: 
			<img class="hicon" src="glutenfree.png" alt="Gluten-free"/> gluten-free,
			<img class="hicon" src="lactosefree.png" alt="Lactose-free"/> lactose-free,
			<img class="hicon" src="sugarfree.png" alt="Sugar-free"/> sugar-free,
			<img class="hicon" src="lowcarb.png" alt="Low-Carb"/> low-carb,
			<img class="hicon" src="lowfat.png" alt="Low-Fat"/> low-fat,
			<img class="hicon" src="highprotein.png" alt="High-Protein"/> high-protein,
			<img class="hicon" src="raw.png" alt="Raw"/> raw,
			<img class="hicon" src="vegan.png" alt="Vegan"/> vegan, and
			<img class="hicon" src="paleo.png" alt="Paleo"/> paleo.
			The macro-nutrient information, or <q>macros</q>as I
			call them, (calories &#x007C; grams protein &#x007C; grams
			carbs &#x007C; grams fat) are stated per serving.
			The number of servings each recipes makes is indicated
			underneath the ingredients list, along with the total
			calories for the entire recipe.  
			Remember, you can always adapt recipe ingredients to
			your liking, and change the serving amounts using the
			change servings tool.  
			
		</p>
		<p>
			The ingredients I use are clean and wholesome. Most of
			my recipes are gluten, lactose and soy-free, and a lot
			of them feature protein powder as a key ingredient.  
			I link the products I use to the websites I bought them
			from, so you can buy them online yourselves. 
			(Note that  <b>all</b> the products I mention are ones I have
			chosen to use myself, because I find them of
			superior quality and taste, suitable for my recipes and
			of course, nutritious.)

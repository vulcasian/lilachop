		<h3>
			Smoothie Recipe Tip: why frozen fruit is better than fresh
		</h3> 
		<p>
			I always prefer to use frozen berries in my smoothies.
			Not only will you get a more ice-cream-like temperature
			and consistency, you'll also probably get more
			nutritional benefits. 
			This may sound counter-intuitive, since we are always
			told to consume fruits and vegetables in their most
			natural state. 
			However, I recently learned that frozen produce
			generally contain more antioxidants, vitamins, and
			minerals, since they are picked for freezing at their
			absolute peak ripeness, versus fresh produce that's
			often picked prior to maturation so that it can better
			survive transportation.

		<h3>Nutritional highlights: what's so super about these superfoods?</h3>
		<p>
			I've learned a lot so far from studying to be a
			<a href="http://www.afpafitness.com/">certified Nutrition &amp; Wellness Consultant</a>.
			For example, dark berries &#8212; especially acai, blueberries,
			and cherries &#8212; have some of the highest antioxidant and
			vitamin contents, making this a top superfood-trio.
			Here's what's so super about these superfoods: 
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<a
					href="http://www.globalhealingcenter.com/natural-health/benefits-of-acai/">Acai</a>:
				native to the Amazon rain forest, the acai berry
				was traditionally used for healing, immunity-
				and energy-boosting energy. 
				Containing almost 10x the amount of
				antioxidants as grapes, acai berries are
				related to slowing the process
				of ageing and preventing diseases related to
				cellular oxidative damage. 

			</li>
			<li>
				<a
					href="http://greatist.com/health/superfood-blueberries">Blueberries</a>:
			       research suggests that blueberries deliver some
			       of the most powerful, wide-ranging, and long-term
			       health benefits due to their high levels of
			       antioxidants and phytonutrients. 
			       Just 1 cup of blueberries per week can lower
			       blood pressure and LDL (bad) cholesterol,
			       neutralise free-radical damage in our cells, and
			       perhaps even speed up metabolism.
			</li>
			<li>
				<a
					href="http://www.globalhealingcenter.com/natural-health/healthy-berries/">Cherries</a>:
				people often forget that cherries are far more
				than just cocktail decoration. 
				Cherries promote cell and tissue health due to
				their antioxidant flavonoid content.
				In addition, cherries contain bioflavonoids
				that can help reduce joint and muscle
				discomfort, and melatonin, a chemical that
				helps you maintain healthy sleep rhythms. 

			</li>
